            <h2>Hello, I'm Regina Mae</h2>
            <p>              
                My full name is Regina Mae Donan Velasco, but my family calls me Regine. I'm already 20 years old, and I'm turning 21 this year, in 2024, and I am the first born among the three. I chose IT because I got interested in technology when I was in senior high school, and now, even though it's so hard, I'm trying my best to learn more.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            I really enjoy a variety of hobbies that bring me joy and relaxation. First off, singing has always been a passion of mine â€“ there's something incredibly freeing about expressing myself through music. Alongside that, I love playing the guitar, creating a harmonious blend of melodies that resonate with my emotions. When it comes to winding down, I find solace in watching anime; the vibrant stories and characters never fail to captivate me. Lastly, reading Wattpad books is another favorite pastime of mine. Exploring the diverse and imaginative worlds crafted by different writers adds a touch of magic to my leisure time. Overall, these hobbies are my go-to outlets for self-expression and pure enjoyment.

        <p>
            I embarked on my educational journey, beginning with elementary school at East Central School. I then proceeded to Daniel Maramba National High School, where I completed my secondary education. Presently, I am a student at Pangasinan State University, dedicated to pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. This academic voyage has provided me with fulfillment and enrichment, enabling me to establish a solid foundation of knowledge and skills in the realm of technology. I eagerly anticipate the ongoing growth and learning that my college experience at Pangasinan State University promises to bring.
